# Predicting-Sleep-Deprivation-Impact-On-Labour-Productivity-Using-a-Hybrid-Model
This project leverages a hybrid voting regressor model combining Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a Feed-Forward Neural Network (FNN) to accurately predict labour productivity. The hybrid model effectively captures complex, non-linear relationships in the data, enhancing prediction performance and generalization.

Key Features:

Hybrid Voting Regressor: Integrates the strengths of Random Forest, SVM, and FNN to deliver robust and reliable productivity predictions.
Flask-based Web Interface: A user-friendly interface enabling real-time input of data, seamlessly integrated with the hybrid model for on-the-fly predictions.
Enhanced Generalization: The model is optimized for a wide range of input scenarios, ensuring adaptability and consistent performance.

This repository includes the code for building the hybrid model, developing the Flask interface, and running predictions with test data. Explore the project to see how advanced machine learning techniques can enhance productivity forecasting!
